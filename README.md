project
In this project of Google African Developers 2020 we created an android application that dispalays scores after a user submits their github link on the application.
The scores are displayed in card view from the first one to the last one. And the list is scorable.
We used Android Studio and Java. 
And connected to a Firebase database. 
The pictures folder shows the important screens.
